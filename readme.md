# FastAPI Multiprocessing Project

This project is a FastAPI application that provides an endpoint for performing addition on lists of integers using Python's multiprocessing capabilities. It is designed to handle batch addition operations asynchronously and return the results along with timestamps and a batch ID.

## Features

- Asynchronous endpoint for batch addition operations.
- Request and response validation using Pydantic models.
- Multiprocessing for concurrent processing of addition tasks.
- Logging for debugging and monitoring purposes.
- Unit tests for service logic and endpoint behavior.
- Organized project structure following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern.
